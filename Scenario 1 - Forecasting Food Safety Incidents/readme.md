Food safety teams have long sat on mountains of incident data-from fresh-produce contamination spikes to repeat hazards in packaged goods. Today, the game is changing: instead of just reporting what happened, we're using time-series forecasting on product-hazard data to predict, and prevent the next outbreak. Think smarter inspection schedules, targeted interventions, and resources deployed exactly when and where they're needed. What was once a dusty archive becomes a real time crystal ball for prevention and preparedness.
