Over the years, food safety authorities and industry partners have collected vast amounts of data on incidents—ranging from contamination spikes in fresh produce to recurring hazards in processed foods. While these records were once used mostly for reporting and retrospective analysis, there is now growing urgency to shift from reactive to predictive approaches.

In this scenario, you’ll explore how time series forecasting can help anticipate future food safety incidents before they occur. Using real-world data on product–hazard combinations, this guide walks you through the process of building forecasting pipelines that can inform early interventions, better inspection timing, and smarter resource allocation. What was once a static archive of incidents becomes a forward-looking tool for **prevention** and **preparedness**.
